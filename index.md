# CIRCLE Group

<h1>Welcome to the CIRCLE Group</h1>
  <h3><em>Center for Intelligence, Representation, Computation, Learning & Embodiment</em></h3>

  <p>
    At <strong>CIRCLE</strong>, we aim to <strong>make machines see</strong>—not just to recognize pixels, but to understand the structure, symmetry, and meaning embedded in the physical and abstract world. We explore the frontiers of <strong>perception, learning, and geometry</strong>, blending deep learning with the mathematical elegance of <em>topology</em>, <em>differential geometry</em>, and <em>quantum theory</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our philosophy is <strong>holistic</strong>: we believe that intelligent systems must be as deeply rooted in <strong>theoretical understanding</strong> as they are in <strong>real-world utility</strong>. We let <em>applications inform learning</em>, and <em>learning theories guide applications</em>—a dual lens that makes our work both principled and impactful.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are driven by curiosity and a commitment to <strong>open, inclusive, transformative science</strong>, inspired by the possibility of a new kind of academia.
  </p>

  <h4>Our research spans:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3D Computer Vision</strong> — Perceiving structure, motion, and semantics in three-dimensional spaces</li>
    <li><strong>3D/4D Generative Priors</strong> — Learning inductive biases for shape, motion, and time</li>
    <li><strong>Geometric & Topological Deep Learning</strong> — Learning on complex domains: graphs, manifolds, and cell complexes</li>
    <li><strong>Statistical & Topological Learning Theory</strong> — Foundations of robustness, generalization, and expressivity</li>
    <li><strong>Quantum Computer Vision</strong> — Reimagining perception and representation at the quantum scale</li>
    <li><strong>Generative Models for Biochemistry</strong> — Designing molecules and proteins with symmetry and structure-aware priors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Join us as we reimagine machine intelligence from the ground up—with <strong>rigor</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>a relentless curiosity</strong> about the world and how we learn to see it.
