# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Projects

We are drawn to deep priors and structural inductive biasesâ€”the kind that bridge disciplines, inspire new mathematics, and expose emergent simplicity within complex systems. Many of our projects sit at the cusp of theory and application, where tools from topology or quantum physics can enable new forms of perception, generation, or understanding. As a result, we publish in a variety of areas that cross-feed each other, including: 3D Computer Vision including 3D/4D Generative Priors, Geometric & Topological Deep Learning, Statistical & Topological Learning Theory, Mechanistic Interpretability, Quantum Computer Vision and Generative Models for Biochemistry.
