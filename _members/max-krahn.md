<strong>Maximilian Krahn</strong> has graduated from the Aalto University in Finland, where he majored in Machine Learning, Data Science and AI. His research interests are in the broad area of Computer Vision. At the Max Planck Institute for Computer Science, he discovered his interest in the development of Computer Vision algorithms. During his time at CYENS he further researched the social impact and inherited biases of Computer Vision algorithms. Maximilian aspires to a career in fair algorithm development. His current interests involve topological deep learning and quantum computer vision. When he is not busy creating new algorithms he enjoys bouldering.
